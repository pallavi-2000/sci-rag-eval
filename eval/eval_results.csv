supernova,What is the smallest total mass of supernova-formed dust inferred in the shell?,About 1.1 ± 0.8 solar masses of dust.,,0.0,Dust mass estimate from conclusions.
supernova,What progenitor mass range is suggested by the dust mass and composition?,A progenitor mass in the range 16–27 solar masses.,,0.0,Progenitor mass constraint from dust composition and yields.
supernova,What does this study imply about the ability of Type IIP supernovae to form dust?,It shows that Type IIP supernovae can efficiently form large quantities of dust in their ejecta and may be significant sources of dust in the Universe.,,0.0,High-level astrophysical implication.
nsbh,What is the main aim of the neutron star–black hole (NSBH) study?,"To report the observation of gravitational waves from two compact binary coalescences consistent with neutron star–black hole binaries, GW200105 and GW200115, and to infer their source properties and merger rate.",,0.0,Overall aim from abstract/introduction.
